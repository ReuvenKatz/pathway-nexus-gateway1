                  <p>
                    I am an experienced PhD coach and consultant, and for the past two decades I've specialized in working with doctoral students who are ready to be empowered and make positive changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pursuing doctoral research and writing a thesis/dissertation present significant challenge. Doctoral students are expected to complete an original research project on their own, sometimes without having the tools to organize it. I help graduate students manage their research projects: plan and execute project tasks in a systematic manner, build solid work habits, improve the relationship with their advisor, and overcome setbacks. My clients gain the confidence to take action that moves them forward, towards successful completion of the doctorate.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My background and experience drive my work with clients individually and in groups. For the past 20 years, I have taught dozens of workshops for doctoral students in the United States, Italy, Poland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. I have observed and studied management patterns among doctoral students in many academic disciplines across several countries. I've found that these patterns are quite similar among most doctoral students. Doctoral candidates spend years studying their academic discipline; however, most of them have not been trained in managing their research tasks. As a result, many candidates encounter obstacles and get stuck in their work. My goal is to assist doctoral students. I've helped dozens of students break through the obstacles that were holding them back in their doctoral journey. Let me help you learn and develop better ways to handle the issues that are standing in the way of your goals, i.e. to graduate successfully, get the Ph.D., and move on with your life and career. Besides guidance on completing the doctorate, I also offer consulting in building your career post-graduation, as elaborated on this website.

                    As a retired Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, I have been working with students of engineering, science and architecture. I have recently been collaborating with Dr. Hila Katz in my consulting practice, as her background is in the humanities, arts and education. You're welcome to read more about both of us at the link below. Have a look around this site and get in touch to see how we can assist you.
