      text: "Dr. Katz, I started my PhD thinking it would be straightforward – research, plan, publish, done! Reality hit hard when I discovered how complex everything really is, from administrative hurdles to challenging advisor relationships. I'm juggling two major studies, and you showed me how to work on both simultaneously while factoring in personal life (like having a baby!). Now I can see the big picture while still managing daily tasks effectively. The best part? Your planning approach gave me something I desperately needed – peace of mind and confidence. When unexpected life events come up recently, instead of panicking, I could calmly reorganize using the framework we created together. I even learned how to better involve my advisor in the process. Thank you for transforming my PhD experience from overwhelming chaos into manageable progress!",

      text: "Hello Reuven, Like many PhD students, I often felt like I was stuck in my own time on the right track. But today, instead of feeling overwhelmed by the massive task of writing a dissertation, I learned to break down my research into smaller, manageable projects with realistic timelines. The organizational techniques I gained help me stay focused day-to-day. What I loved most is that you gave me specific advice on staying operational and communicating more effectively with my advisor. The individual meetings were incredibly valuable and tailored to my exact needs. Now, I am motivated and excited to create my project plans – that enthusiasm has stayed with me ever since!",

      text: "Hi Reuven, Thank you for your effective consulting. My advisors were impressed when I showed them my new research plan. Now I update it each semester, track what worked (and what didn't), and discuss any changes with them. I've even shared my knowledge with my lab mates, and they're really interested in applying these techniques too. Thanks for such a practical and encouraging experience!",
